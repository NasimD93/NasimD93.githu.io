<p>After working a 6 month temporary contract I was made permanent and I’ve been with FTB for around 1year and a half. I started this role when the business launched.
Working in this role I’m required to liaise with GP’s, hospitals, patients and patient families in regards to their mental health. My daily duties include using our clinical systems putting in referrals making sure we pay attention to patient details.
 I aslo dealt with the high volume calls daily and practiced confidentiality. Relay very important patient information. Working in a team and delegating .<p/>
